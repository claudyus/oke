oke - OpenWrt Kernel Extractor
----------------------------------

oke is an command line utility developer to "extract" a version of kernel from 
Openwrt developer branch. Openwrt use an highly customization kernel with a lot
of improvement and not upstream patches that are useful also outside of OpenWrt 
project.

This simple program is intend to be used to extract a patched kernel for a specific
target platform both from trunk that stable openwrt release.
You can also include generic patches or just the arch specific one.

USAGE
---------
./oke -a <arch> [-r <revison>] [-b <trunk|kamikaze|backfire>] [-g]
	Extract kernel for arch at revision from branch.
	If -r is not present HEAD is assumed
	If -b option is not present trunk is assumed
	If -g is used try to extract a kernel for arch but
	  without generic patches 
	  (this command can fail if some arch specific patch
	  is based on a generic one)

./oke -l [-b <trunk|kamikaze|backfire>]
	List the supported arch per branch
	If -b option is not present trunk is assumed

./oke -h
